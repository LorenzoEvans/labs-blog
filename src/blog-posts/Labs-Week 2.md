#### _Part One:_ *Individual Accomplishments.*

Honestly, I'm not sure I have an individual accomplishment this week. A lot of my work was collaborative, in that, I started some things, helped debug, and research,
but a lot of those things ended up being passed on to other team members, who then finished, or carried out, or executed upon that. Due to the nature of some of the challenges,
and the variations between each team mates understanding of certain tools, or concepts that needed to be made use of, and the size of some of the features, there was just, for me,
never a particularly good time to go off and work on something by myself, that I could turn around and say I did this, and be referring to a whole feature.
I know that on a team of developers, value doesn't just get added by adding code, or features, but it's very hard to not judge myself as a developer based on that metric. I guess, at the end of the day, I would hope that, if asked, my team-mates would feel different about the level or quality of my contributions this week, than I do. If anything, I suppose an individual accomplishment would be my ability to step back and look at myself honestly and say, I don't think I met my standards, and begin to ask myself what lead to that, and what I can change so that I don't feel this way next time around.
