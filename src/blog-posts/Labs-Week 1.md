This week was honestly arduous, considering the change in the number of team-mates we had, and the challenges faced by me and a team-mate with regards to implementing 
Firebase. It was an experience that taught me both how much I've learned, and how strong my skills are, but also how much I have to learn, and what areas I'm weak in,
some of which extend beyond software into communication, conflict resolution, and explaining my own thought process. Some of the biggest difficulties were conforming to the rules of
various 3rd party services, such as Google and Github, within the confines of Firebase. Twitter, Google, and Github all return JSON user objects that are shaped differently, which meant we had to effectively search these objects and find the pieces of data we needed to feed back to Firebase. Another difficulty was the immense size of Firebase functionality, as they offer services for iOS, Web, Android, Node, etc, and each of these are complex tools, and the documentation. It can become difficult at times, to keep track of where you've been, what you've looked at, what you actually need, or what you were even looking for in the first place. That being said, there's absolutely nothing like the reward of pulling off a task, and serving up a feature right in the nick of time, that you've been working on for two weeks.
```javascript
const foo = {
  bar: 'test'
}

console.log(foo)
```
