So, this first week was really interesting, because the feeling of working in team is very different, it's interesting to not have control over how things are done, while knowing that with that comes a support system and resource pool in the form of the people you're sharing control with. Seeing as how we haven't quite gotten into the meat of developing yet, I tried to provide support, reason, patience and valuable input to the conversations had about what set of tools we would use, and how we would use them. Currently, I'm focusing on working through a very extensive GraphQL tutorial, in which I'm building a hackernoon clone, which implements the majority, if not all of the stack we're using (Prisma, MongoDB, etc), while reading through the also extensive documentation as necessary to find the specific information and techniques needed to meet all of the obligations of the application we're working on. GraphQL and Prisma combined offer a very different feeling with regards to API/Database development, sometimes referred to as "Schema Driven Development", which is very accurate, as you model your business domain through the types you define in your schema, and the rest of the app condenses around that schema, and the relationships and operations it generates via Prisma. I'm quite excited to start folding in MongoDB, because it's entirely different from SQL as a DBMS, and I think it will play better with the flexible nature of GQL and Prisma.
